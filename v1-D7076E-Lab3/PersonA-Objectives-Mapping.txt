================================================================================
              FILE 1: PersonA-app.py - FLASK REST API
================================================================================

LAB OBJECTIVE MAPPING:
----------------------

✓ TASK 1: Flask REST API (Lines 1-97)
  Requirement: /register, /login, /mfa/*; store users in SQLite
  Implementation:
    • Lines 1-10: Flask imports and setup
    • Line 10: PEPPER = b"system_pepper_secret_key" (system-wide secret)
    • Lines 12-21: init_db() creates SQLite users table
    • Lines 15-19: Schema: username, salt, hash, hash_type
    • Lines 50-88: /register endpoint - creates users with chosen hash
    • Lines 90-93: /login endpoint - basic authentication check
    • Line 97: Runs on port 5000

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE
  Note: MFA endpoints handled by PersonB (PersonB-integrated_app.py)


✓ TASK 2: Password Storage - 4 Hash Algorithms (Lines 23-42)
  Requirement: Implement SHA-256, SHA-3, bcrypt, Argon2
  Implementation:
    • Lines 24-28: hash_sha256() - SHA-256 with iterations
      → Line 25: Rounds=100 (configurable cost parameter)
      → Line 26: Combines password + salt + pepper
      → Line 27: 100 iterations of SHA-256
    
    • Lines 30-34: hash_sha3() - SHA-3 with iterations
      → Line 31: Rounds=100 (configurable)
      → Line 33: Uses sha3_256 variant
    
    • Lines 36-38: hash_bcrypt() - bcrypt
      → Line 37: Rounds=8 (cost parameter)
      → Uses bcrypt.gensalt() for automatic salting
    
    • Lines 39-41: hash_argon2() - Argon2
      → Line 40: time_cost=1, memory_cost=8192 (cost parameters)
      → Memory-hard function for GPU resistance
    
    • Lines 61-73: /register routes to appropriate hash function
      → User can specify hash_type in request
      → Default: bcrypt (line 55)

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE - All 4 algorithms implemented
  Cost Parameters: ✓ Configurable (rounds, time_cost, memory_cost)


✓ TASK 3: Salt & Pepper Analysis (Lines 10, 59, 25-26, 36-37)
  Requirement: Demonstrate per-user salts vs system pepper
  Implementation:
    • Line 10: PEPPER = b"system_pepper_secret_key"
      → System-wide secret (NOT stored in database)
      → Same for all users
      → Makes rainbow tables useless even with salt
    
    • Line 59: salt = secrets.token_bytes(32)
      → Generates 32-byte random salt PER USER
      → Unique for each user

    • Lines 25-26, 31-32: password + salt + PEPPER
      → Shows combination of both salt and pepper
      → Salt: stored, unique per user
      → Pepper: secret, shared across all users
    
    • Lines 66-70: bcrypt/Argon2 don't store separate salt
      → bcrypt includes salt in output hash
      → Line 67: salt = b'' for bcrypt/Argon2

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE
  Demonstrates: Both per-user salt AND system pepper
  Impact: Rainbow table attacks prevented by both mechanisms


✓ TASK 4: HMAC & Integrity (Lines 45-48, 88, 93)

  Implementation:
    • Lines 45-48: add_hmac() function
      → Line 46: Uses hmac.new() with secret key
      → Hashes entire response with SHA-256
      → Returns hexdigest (64-character hex string)
      → Line 47: Adds 'mac' field to response
    
    • Line 88: add_hmac(response) on registration
      → Every /register response includes MAC
      → Client can verify response integrity
    
    • Line 93: add_hmac(response) on login
      → Every /login response includes MAC
      → Prevents tampering with authentication responses
    
  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE

  Note: Constant-time comparison shown in timing_attack.py


SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
-------------------------------
1. ✓ Configurable hash algorithms (4 options)
2. ✓ Adjustable cost parameters (rounds, time_cost, memory_cost)
3. ✓ Per-user salt generation (32 bytes)
4. ✓ System-wide pepper (not stored in DB)
5. ✓ HMAC integrity protection on all responses

MISSING FROM PersonA-app.py (Handled by PersonB):
-------------------------------------------------
• MFA endpoints (/mfa/*)
• Password verification in /login (basic placeholder only)
• TOTP/HOTP implementation
• WebAuthn/FIDO2 integration
• MFA logs table

These are intentionally split to PersonB-integrated_app.py for team division.


================================================================================
          FILE 2: PersonA-crack_passwords.py - CRACKING DEMO
================================================================================

LAB OBJECTIVE MAPPING:
----------------------

✓ TASK 7: Password Cracking (Lines 1-42)
  Requirement: Dictionary and brute-force attacks; log time-to-crack
  Implementation:
    • Lines 6-29: crack_sha256() - brute force function
      → Line 8: Character set: lowercase (a-z) + digits (0-9) = 36 chars
      → Line 9: Tracks start time
      → Line 10: Counts attempts
      → Lines 12-13: Iterates through password lengths 1 to max_length
      → Line 14: itertools.product() generates all combinations
      → Lines 18-20: Replicates SHA-256 hashing with 100,000 iterations
      → Line 22: Compares against target hash
      → Line 24: Returns password, attempts, elapsed time
      → Line 27: Progress indicator every 1000 attempts
    
    • Lines 32-42: Test demonstration
      → Line 34: Uses test salt
      → Line 35: Target password: "abc"
      → Lines 36-38: Creates test hash with 100,000 iterations
      → Line 41: Attempts to crack with max_length=4
      → Line 42: Outputs result (password, attempts, time)

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE (Brute force)
  Note: Dictionary attack in PersonB-dictionary_attack.py

  Algorithm: SHA-256 with 100,000 iterations
  Target: Short password "abc" (3 characters)
  Purpose: Demonstrates difficulty even with iterations


WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES:
------------------------
1. Brute Force Attack Mechanics
   → Systematic trying of all combinations
   → Character set determines search space
   → Password length exponentially increases attempts
   → 36^1 + 36^2 + 36^3 = 36 + 1,296 + 46,656 = 47,988 attempts for "abc"

2. Cost of Iteration Rounds
   → Each attempt requires 100,000 SHA-256 hashes
   → Dramatically slows down cracking
   → Makes brute force impractical for long passwords

3. Attack Complexity
   → 3-char password: ~48K attempts
   → 4-char password: ~1.7M attempts
   → 5-char password: ~61M attempts
   → Shows exponential growth

4. Time-to-Crack Measurement
   → Actual timing data for report
   → Demonstrates effectiveness of iterations
   → Justifies bcrypt/Argon2 over simple hashing


RELATION TO SALT & PEPPER:
---------------------------
• Line 18: Includes salt and pepper in hash computation
• Attacker must know or guess both salt and pepper
• Without salt: Rainbow tables work (pre-computed hashes)
• With salt: Must crack each user individually
• With pepper: Must guess system secret (not in DB)


FOR THE REPORT:
---------------
Use this script to show:
• Time to crack short passwords (abc, ab1, etc.)
• Effect of iteration rounds on cracking time
• Why longer passwords are critical
• Comparison with PersonB-dictionary_attack.py results


================================================================================
        FILE 3: PersonA-timing_attack.py - TIMING SIDE-CHANNEL
================================================================================

LAB OBJECTIVE MAPPING:
----------------------

✓ TASK 8: Timing Attacks (Lines 1-46)
  Requirement: Implement naive comparisons and micro-benchmarks; show timing
               leakage; demonstrate mitigation via constant-time comparison
  Implementation:
    • Lines 5-7: naive_compare() - VULNERABLE
      → Line 7: return a == b
      → Python's == operator stops at first mismatch
      → Early characters that match take LONGER to compare
      → Creates timing side-channel vulnerability
    
    • Lines 9-11: secure_compare() - SECURE
      → Line 11: return hmac.compare_digest(a, b)
      → Always compares entire string
      → Constant time regardless of matches
      → Prevents timing leakage
    
    • Lines 13-43: timing_demo() - Micro-benchmark
      → Line 14: Correct hash (64 chars)
      → Lines 17-21: Three test cases with different match patterns:
        1. Differs from start (0 matching chars)
        2. Matches 40 chars, then differs
        3. Matches 63 chars, differs at end
      
      → Lines 28-32: Measure naive comparison 1000 times
        → Uses time.perf_counter() for precision
        → Calculates statistics
      
      → Lines 35-39: Measure secure comparison 1000 times
        → Same methodology
        → Shows constant time behavior
      
      → Lines 42-43: Outputs average times
        → Scientific notation (e.g., 1.43e-07 = 0.000000143 seconds)
        → Shows timing differences

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE
  Vulnerability: Demonstrated
  Mitigation: Implemented and proven


WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES:
------------------------
1. Timing Side-Channel Vulnerability
   → Naive comparison leaks information
   → Different timings reveal character matches
   → Attacker can guess password character by character

2. Attack Methodology
   → Try all first characters, measure time
   → Longest time = correct character
   → Move to next character and repeat
   → Reduces N^M complexity to N*M

3. Constant-Time Mitigation
   → hmac.compare_digest() always takes same time
   → No correlation between matches and timing
   → Prevents side-channel attack

4. Real-World Implications
   → Remote timing attacks are possible
   → Network jitter makes it harder but not impossible
   → Always use constant-time comparison for secrets


MICRO-BENCHMARK DETAILS:
------------------------
• 1000 iterations per test case (line 28, 35)
• time.perf_counter() for nanosecond precision (lines 29, 30, 36, 37)
• statistics.mean() for averaging (lines 42, 43)
• Scientific notation output for readability


RELATION TO HMAC IN PersonA-app.py:
------------------------------------
• PersonA-app.py line 46: Uses hmac for response integrity
• This file: Uses hmac.compare_digest() for constant-time comparison
• Both demonstrate HMAC security benefits
• Shows proper implementation of Task 4 requirement


FOR THE REPORT:
---------------
• Show output with timing differences for naive comparison
• Show consistent times for secure comparison
• Explain character-by-character guessing attack
• Prove mitigation effectiveness

            FILE 4: PersonA-testing.py - API TEST SCRIPT
================================================================================

LAB OBJECTIVE MAPPING:
----------------------

✓ SUPPORTING TASK: Testing & Validation (Lines 1-25)
  Purpose: Validate Flask API endpoints and hash algorithm implementations
  Implementation:
    • Lines 1-3: Imports requests library for HTTP testing
    • Line 4: BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000"
    
    • Lines 6-16: test_registration()
      → Lines 8-12: Creates test users with different hash types
        - user1: SHA-256
        - user2: bcrypt
        - user3: Argon2
      → Lines 14-16: Sends POST to /register for each user
      → Prints response showing success/failure and hash type
    
    • Lines 18-21: test_login()
      → Tests /login endpoint
      → Sends credentials
      → Prints response with HMAC
    
    • Lines 23-25: Main execution
      → Runs registration tests
      → Runs login test

  Coverage: ✓ COMPLETE (for testing purposes)
  Purpose: Quality assurance, not a lab requirement


WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES:
------------------------
1. API Functionality Verification
   → Confirms /register endpoint works
   → Confirms /login endpoint responds
   → Validates JSON request/response format

2. Multi-Algorithm Testing
   → Tests all 4 hash algorithms
   → Ensures each stores correctly in database
   → Validates hash_type parameter handling

3. HMAC Response Validation
   → Every response includes MAC field
   → Can be used to verify response integrity
   → Demonstrates Task 4 implementation

4. Development & Debugging Tool
   → Quick way to populate test database
   → Useful for development iteration
   → Validates changes don't break functionality


USAGE IN WORKFLOW:
------------------
1. Start PersonA-app.py server
2. Run PersonA-testing.py to create test users
3. Check database to see different hash types
4. Use for demonstrations in report


NOT A DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENT:
-------------------------------
This is a supporting tool, not explicitly required by Lab3 tasks.
However, it's good engineering practice and helps with:
• Demonstrating that the API works
• Creating test data quickly
• Validating implementations
