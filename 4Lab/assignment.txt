Lab 4: Secure E-Mail and DNS
Due Monday by 12:59am Points 0 Submitting a file upload
Aim:
Emulate a small ISP/domain network with mail and DNS servers.
Demonstrate basic e-mail delivery using SMTP and DNS MX records.
Explore vulnerabilities such as DNS spoofing/poisoning and unauthenticated e-mail headers.
Apply DNSSEC and e-mail authentication mechanisms (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) to harden the setup.
Analyze how these protocols protect against phishing, spoofing, and message tampering.
 

Tasks:

Build a simple topology with at least: a client host, a mail server (Postfix/Exim), and a DNS server (Bind/Unbound).
Configure the DNS server with A/MX records for the mail server.
Verify that client can resolve example.com and send e-mail to the server.
Simulate a DNS spoof/poison attack (e.g., intercept/forge a DNS response so mail is delivered to a fake server).
Show that the client accepts a spoofed MX record or an e-mail with a forged From:
Enable DNSSEC on the DNS server and configure client validation.
Add an SPF record to the DNS zone and test sender IP validation.
Configure DKIM signing on the mail server and verify signatures with the client.
Optionally set up a DMARC policy and test how failed messages are handled.
Compare traffic and logs before and after enabling protections.
Document how spoofing attacks succeed in the insecure setup and fail once DNSSEC/SPF/DKIM/DMARC are active.
