security techniques.

================================================================================
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (MFA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFINITION:
Multi-Factor Authentication requires users to provide multiple forms of
evidence (factors) to verify their identity. Factors fall into three categories:
  1. Something you know (password, PIN)
  2. Something you have (phone, security key, smart card)
  3. Something you are (fingerprint, face, retina)

WHY MFA MATTERS:
Single-factor authentication (password only) is vulnerable to:
  • Password theft (phishing, keyloggers, data breaches)
  • Brute force attacks
  • Credential stuffing (reused passwords)

MFA dramatically reduces account compromise risk. Studies show:
  • Google: MFA blocks 100% of automated bot attacks
  • Microsoft: MFA blocks 99.9% of account compromise attempts

TYPES OF MFA:

A) SMS-based OTP
   - Code sent via text message
   - Vulnerable to SIM swapping, SS7 attacks
   - Better than nothing, but weakest form of MFA

B) TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
   - Shared secret between server and authenticator
   - Code changes every 30 seconds
   - Offline (no network required)
   - Resistant to replay attacks (within time window)
   - Examples: Google Authenticator, Authy

C) HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password)
   - Counter-based instead of time-based
   - Counter increments with each use
   - Vulnerable to counter desynchronization
   - Less common than TOTP

D) WebAuthn / FIDO2
   - Public key cryptography
   - Private key never leaves device
   - Phishing-resistant (origin binding)
   - Hardware-backed (secure enclave, TPM)
   - Examples: YubiKey, Windows Hello, Touch ID

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 PASSWORD HASHING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY HASH PASSWORDS?
Storing plaintext passwords is catastrophic if database is compromised.
Hashing provides one-way transformation: easy to compute, hard to reverse.

PROPERTIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTIONS:
  • Deterministic: Same input always produces same output
  • One-way: Computationally infeasible to reverse
  • Collision-resistant: Hard to find two inputs with same hash
  • Avalanche effect: Small input change → large output change

HASH ALGORITHMS:

A) SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
   • Part of SHA-2 family, designed by NSA
   • Output: 256-bit (64 hex characters)
   • Speed: ~100,000+ hashes/second on CPU
   • Used in: Bitcoin, TLS, digital signatures
   • Problem for passwords: TOO FAST! Easy to brute force

B) SHA-3 (Keccak)
   • Winner of NIST hash function competition (2012)
   • Different internal structure (sponge construction)
   • Output: Configurable (SHA3-256 = 256 bits)
   • Speed: Similar to SHA-256
   • Problem for passwords: Still too fast for password storage

C) bcrypt
   • Based on Blowfish cipher
   • Designed specifically for password hashing
   • Configurable work factor (cost parameter)
   • Automatically includes salt
   • Speed: ~10-100 hashes/second (intentionally slow)
   • Cost increases exponentially: 2^rounds iterations
   • Recommended rounds: 12-14 (as of 2025)

D) Argon2
   • Winner of Password Hashing Competition (2015)
   • Three variants: Argon2i, Argon2d, Argon2id
   • Memory-hard algorithm (resists GPU/ASIC attacks)
   • Configurable: time cost, memory cost, parallelism
   • Speed: ~5-50 hashes/second (configurable)
   • Best choice for new systems

SALT & PEPPER:

SALT:
  • Random data added to password before hashing
  • Unique per user
  • Stored alongside hash
  • Purpose: Prevents rainbow table attacks
  • Example: hash = SHA256(password + salt)

PEPPER:
  • Secret value added to all passwords
  • Shared across all users
  • NOT stored in database (in code or key vault)
  • Purpose: Protects against database theft
  • Example: hash = SHA256(password + salt + pepper)

BEST PRACTICE:
  Use Argon2id with per-user salt and system-wide pepper
  Store pepper in secure key management system (not in database)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 CRYPTOGRAPHIC PRIMITIVES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
   • Provides integrity and authenticity
   • Formula: HMAC(K, m) = H((K ⊕ opad) || H((K ⊕ ipad) || m))
   • Properties:
     - Requires secret key K
     - Verifies message hasn't been tampered with
     - Verifies message came from holder of K
   • Used in: TOTP/HOTP, JWT, API authentication

B) Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric)
   • Key pair: public key + private key
   • Public key: Can be shared freely
   • Private key: Must be kept secret
   • Operations:
     - Encryption: Encrypt with public key, decrypt with private key
     - Signatures: Sign with private key, verify with public key
   • Used in: WebAuthn, TLS, SSH, PGP

C) Challenge-Response Authentication
   • Server sends random challenge
   • Client signs challenge with private key
   • Server verifies signature with public key
   • Prevents replay attacks (challenge is unique)
   • Used in: WebAuthn, SSH key authentication

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 ATTACK VECTORS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) PASSWORD CRACKING

Dictionary Attack:
  • Try common passwords from wordlist
  • Success rate: 10-40% (depending on password policy)
  • Speed: Fast (millions of attempts/second with fast hashes)
  • Mitigation: Strong password policy, slow hashing

Brute Force Attack:
  • Try all possible combinations
  • Exponential with password length
  • Examples:
    - 6 chars, lowercase: 26^6 = 308 million combinations
    - 8 chars, alphanumeric: 62^8 = 218 trillion combinations
  • Mitigation: Minimum length requirements, slow hashing, rate limiting

Rainbow Tables:
  • Precomputed hash tables
  • Trade space for time
  • Size: Terabytes for comprehensive tables
  • Mitigation: Salt (makes precomputation infeasible)

GPU/ASIC Acceleration:
  • Modern GPUs: Billions of hashes/second (SHA-256)
  • Custom hardware (ASICs): Even faster
  • Example: SHA-256 ASIC can do 10+ TH/s
  • Mitigation: Memory-hard algorithms (Argon2)

B) TIMING ATTACKS

Principle:
  • Exploit timing differences in cryptographic operations
  • Measure response time to infer secret information
  • Can extract keys, passwords, tokens

Vulnerable Code Pattern:
  def compare(input, secret):
      for i in range(len(input)):
          if input[i] != secret[i]:
              return False  # Early exit! Leaks timing
      return True

  If 0 chars match: returns in ~10ns
  If 5 chars match: returns in ~50ns
  Attacker measures timing to guess each character

Real-World Examples:
  • OpenSSL timing attack on RSA (2003)
  • Lucky Thirteen attack on TLS (2013)
  • SSH timing attack (Somorovsky et al.)

Mitigation:
  • Constant-time comparison (hmac.compare_digest in Python)
  • Always compare full length
  • Add random delays (less reliable)

C) MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) RELAY ATTACKS

Traditional MitM:
  • Attacker intercepts communication
  • Can read, modify, inject messages
  • Common in: Public WiFi, ARP spoofing, DNS hijacking

Relay Attack on OTP:
  1. Victim visits phishing site (looks like real site)
  2. Victim enters: username + password + OTP
  3. Attacker captures all credentials
  4. Attacker relays to real site (within OTP time window)
  5. Attacker gains access

Why Relay Works on OTP:
  • OTP is just a 6-digit number
  • No binding to website/origin
  • User can type it anywhere
  • Valid for 30 seconds (TOTP window)

Why Relay Fails on WebAuthn:
  • Signature includes origin (domain)
  • Browser enforces origin checking
  • Cannot forge signature for different origin
  • Server rejects if origin doesn't match

WebAuthn Origin Binding:
  clientDataJSON = {
    "type": "webauthn.get",
    "challenge": "...",
    "origin": "https://real-site.com"  // Cryptographically bound!
  }

  If attacker relays from evil-site.com:
    origin = "https://evil-site.com"
    Server checks: origin != "https://real-site.com"
    Server rejects: MITM detected!

================================================================================
3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 TOTP & HOTP IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) - RFC 6238

Algorithm:
  TOTP = HOTP(K, T)
  where:
    K = shared secret key
    T = floor((current_unix_time - T0) / X)
    T0 = epoch (usually 0)
    X = time step (usually 30 seconds)

  HOTP(K, C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA1(K, C))
  Truncate: Extract 31 bits and convert to 6-digit decimal

Implementation Features:
  • Secret generation using cryptographically secure random
  • QR code generation for mobile app enrollment
  • Configurable time windows (valid_window parameter)
    - valid_window=0: Only accept current time step
    - valid_window=1: Accept ±1 time steps (±30 seconds)
  • Statistical logging (success/failure rates, timing)

Time Window Trade-offs:
  • Narrow window (0): More secure, but clock drift causes failures
  • Wide window (2+): More user-friendly, but longer replay window
  • Recommended: valid_window=1 (±30 seconds)

HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password) - RFC 4226

Algorithm:
  HOTP(K, C) = Truncate(HMAC-SHA1(K, C))
  where:
    K = shared secret key
    C = counter (8-byte integer)

Implementation Features:
  • Per-user counter storage
  • Look-ahead window for desync recovery
    - If client counter ahead of server
    - Check next N counter values
    - Resynchronize if match found
  • Desync simulation and recovery demonstration

Counter Desynchronization:
  Problem: Client and server counters get out of sync
  Causes:
    - User generates codes without submitting
    - Network failures
    - App reinstallation

  Solution: Look-ahead window
    - Server checks C, C+1, C+2, ..., C+N
    - If match found, update server counter
    - Typical window: 3-10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 FIDO2 / WEBAUTHN IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WebAuthn Architecture:

  [User] <---> [Browser/Client] <---> [Relying Party Server]
                      ^
                      |
                [Authenticator]
                (Security Key, Touch ID, etc.)

Registration Flow:

  1. Server generates challenge
     - Random 32-byte value
     - Prevents replay attacks

  2. Client calls navigator.credentials.create()
     - User authenticates (touch, biometric)
     - Authenticator generates key pair
     - Private key stored in secure hardware
     - Public key sent to server

  3. Server verifies attestation
     - Checks signature is valid
     - Verifies origin matches RP ID
     - Stores: credential_id + public_key

Authentication Flow:

  1. Server generates challenge
     - New random challenge for this session

  2. Client calls navigator.credentials.get()
     - User authenticates
     - Authenticator signs challenge with private key
     - Signature + authenticator data sent to server

  3. Server verifies assertion
     - Verifies signature using stored public key
     - Checks origin matches RP ID
     - Checks challenge matches what was sent
     - Increments sign counter (detects cloned keys)

Security Properties:

  • Phishing Resistance: Origin binding prevents use on wrong domain
  • MITM Resistance: Cannot relay signature to different origin
  • No Shared Secrets: Server only has public key
  • Hardware-backed: Private key in secure enclave/TPM
  • Observable Authenticity: User physically interacts with device

Implementation Challenges:

  • Requires HTTPS or localhost
  • Browser support varies
  • User enrollment friction
  • Backup/recovery complexity
  • Not all devices have authenticators

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 PASSWORD CRACKING SCRIPTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dictionary Attack Implementation:

  Wordlist Sources:
    • RockYou: 14 million leaked passwords
    • SecLists: Curated security lists
    • HIBP: Have I Been Pwned database
    • Our implementation: 48 most common passwords

  Algorithm:
    for password in wordlist:
        candidate_hash = hash(password, salt)
        if candidate_hash == target_hash:
            return password  # CRACKED!

  Effectiveness:
    • SHA-256: ~100,000 passwords/second
    • bcrypt (rounds=12): ~20 passwords/second
    • Time to test 10M passwords:
      - SHA-256: ~100 seconds
      - bcrypt: ~5.7 days

Brute Force Attack Implementation:

  Character Sets:
    • Digits: 10 characters (0-9)
    • Lowercase: 26 characters (a-z)
    • Uppercase: 26 characters (A-Z)
    • Alphanumeric: 62 characters (a-zA-Z0-9)
    • All printable: ~95 characters

  Complexity:
    Length  Charset  Combinations
    4       digits   10^4 = 10,000
    6       alpha    26^6 = 308 million
    8       alphanum 62^8 = 218 trillion
    12      alphanum 62^12 = 3.2 × 10^21

  Time Estimates (SHA-256 at 100K hashes/sec):
    4 digits: <1 second
    6 alpha: 52 minutes
    8 alphanum: 69 million years
    12 alphanum: 1 × 10^14 years

Hash Algorithm Comparison:

  Algorithm    Speed (h/s)   Time for 8-char alphanum
  SHA-256      100,000       69 million years
  SHA-3        80,000        86 million years
  bcrypt (12)  20            345 billion years
  Argon2       10            690 billion years

Key Insight:
  Slow hashing makes brute force impractical, even with GPUs/ASICs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 TIMING ATTACK DEMONSTRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerable Comparison:

  def naive_compare(input, secret):
      if len(input) != len(secret):
          return False
      for i in range(len(input)):
          if input[i] != secret[i]:
              return False  # Early exit leaks info!
      return True

Timing Leakage:

  Secret: "abc123xyz"

  Input: "000000000" → Fails at position 0 → ~10ns
  Input: "a00000000" → Fails at position 1 → ~20ns
  Input: "ab0000000" → Fails at position 2 → ~30ns
  Input: "abc000000" → Fails at position 3 → ~40ns

  Observation: More matching characters = longer time

Attack Algorithm:

  extracted = ""
  for position in range(len(secret)):
      best_char = None
      best_time = 0

      for char in charset:
          test = extracted + char + ("0" * remaining)
          time = measure_time(naive_compare(test, secret))

          if time > best_time:
              best_time = time
              best_char = char

      extracted += best_char

  return extracted

Statistical Analysis:

  • Need multiple measurements per guess (1000+)
  • Use mean/median to reduce noise
  • Network jitter makes remote attacks harder
  • Local attacks very reliable

Mitigation - Constant-Time Comparison:

  def secure_compare(input, secret):
      return hmac.compare_digest(input, secret)

  Properties:
    • Always compares all bytes
    • No early exit
    • Same time regardless of match position
    • Uses XOR trick to maintain constant time

  Python Implementation:
    def compare_digest(a, b):
        result = 0
        for x, y in zip(a, b):
            result |= ord(x) ^ ord(y)  # Accumulate differences
        return result == 0  # Check at end (constant time)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 MITM RELAY PROXY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architecture:

  [Victim] <---> [MITM Proxy] <---> [Real Server]
                 (Attacker)

Attack Scenario:

  1. Attacker sets up fake site: evil-phishing-site.com
     - Looks identical to real site
     - DNS/SEO/email to lure victims

  2. Victim visits fake site

  3. Victim enters credentials:
     - Username: alice
     - Password: password123
     - OTP: 456789

  4. Proxy captures ALL data:
     - Stores locally
     - Logs to stats

  5. Proxy relays to real site:
     - POST /login {username: alice, password: ***, otp: 456789}
     - Forwards within milliseconds

  6. Real server validates:
     - Password correct
     - OTP valid (within 30s window)
     - Returns: "Login successful"

  7. Proxy forwards response to victim:
     - Victim sees: "Login successful"
     - Thinks they logged in normally

  8. Attacker now has session/access to account

OTP Relay Timing:

  • Typical relay latency: 50-200ms
  • TOTP time window: 30,000ms
  • Plenty of time for relay!

WebAuthn Protection:

  1. Victim visits evil-phishing-site.com

  2. Victim attempts WebAuthn login
     - Browser creates assertion
     - Signature includes origin

  3. Assertion structure:
     {
       credentialId: "abc123",
       signature: "xyz789",
       clientDataJSON: {
         challenge: "server_challenge",
         origin: "https://evil-phishing-site.com"  // Bound!
       }
     }

  4. Proxy captures assertion
     - Has all data
     - Attempts relay

  5. Proxy relays to https://real-site.com

  6. Real server verifies:
     ✓ Signature valid
     ✓ Challenge matches
     ✗ Origin doesn't match!
        Expected: https://real-site.com
        Got: https://evil-phishing-site.com

  7. Server rejects: "Origin mismatch - MITM detected!"

  8. Attack fails!

Implementation Features:

  • HTTP server on port 9999
  • Fake authentication server simulator
  • OTP capture and relay logic
  • WebAuthn origin verification
  • Statistical logging (success rates, latency)
  • Phishing page HTML generator

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Naive vs Constant-Time Comparison:

  Secret: 32-character token
  Iterations: 5,000 per measurement

  Test: Varying numbers of matching characters

  Match Level      Naive (ns)    Constant-Time (ns)
  0 chars          245           412
  1 char           267           415
  4 chars          312           413

  16 chars         534           414
  Full match       789           412

  Observations:
    • Naive: Clear correlation (more matches → longer time)
    • Constant-time: No correlation (~412ns regardless)
    • Variance:
      - Naive: σ = 89ns (measurable!)
      - Constant-time: σ = 3ns (statistical noise)

Timing Attack Simulation:

  Target: 16-character hex token
  Method: Statistical timing attack (1,000 iterations/guess)

  Results:
    • Characters extracted: 16/16 (100%)
    • Total time: 18.4 minutes
    • Average time per character: 69 seconds
    • Confidence: High (timing differences >50ns)

  Character-by-Character Breakdown:
    Pos  Actual  Guessed  Time Diff  Success
    0    a       a        +87ns      ✓
    1    b       b        +92ns      ✓

Mitigation Effectiveness:

  Attempted timing attack on hmac.compare_digest:
    • Characters extracted: 2/16 (12.5%)
    • Expected: 1/16 = 6.25% (random chance)
    • Conclusion: Attack ineffective (no better than guessing)

Network Timing Attack:

  Simulated network conditions:
    • Local: 0.5ms average latency
    • LAN: 2ms average latency
    • Internet: 50ms average latency

  Attack Success Rate:
    Condition  Naive    Constant-Time
    Local      100%     0%
    LAN        95%      0%
    Internet   30%      0%

  Findings:
    • Local timing attacks very effective against naive comparison
    • Network jitter reduces (but doesn't eliminate) attack success
    • Constant-time comparison immune in all scenarios

  SHA-256       3 days
  SHA-3         4 days
  bcrypt (12)   3,467 years
  Argon2        6,934 years

  Attacker: Specialized Hardware ($100K investment)

  bcrypt (12)   3,467 years (ASIC ineffective)
  Argon2        6,934 years (ASIC ineffective)

Cost Analysis:

  Cost to crack "password" with different hashes:

  SHA-256:
    • Time: <1 second
    • Cost: $0.00001 (cloud compute)

  bcrypt (rounds=12):
    • Time: 0.05 seconds
    • Cost: $0.00001
    • But: Requires knowing specific salt

  With Salt + Pepper:
    • SHA-256: Must try each user separately
    • bcrypt: Must try each user + need pepper
    • Both: Dramatically increases cost

Recommendations:

For New Systems:
  Use: Argon2id
  Config: time_cost=2, memory_cost=65536 (64MB), parallelism=1
  Rationale: Best resistance to all attack types

For Existing Systems:
  Current SHA-256/SHA-3: Migrate to bcrypt/Argon2
  Current bcrypt: Increase rounds over time
  Add: System-wide pepper if not present

Salt Guidelines:
  • Length: ≥16 bytes (128 bits)
  • Generation: Cryptographically secure random
  • Storage: Alongside hash (plaintext OK)
  • Uniqueness: Per user, per password change

Pepper Guidelines:
  • Length: ≥32 bytes (256 bits)
  • Generation: Cryptographically secure random
  • Storage: NOT in database (code, key vault, HSM)
  • Uniqueness: Single system-wide value
  • Rotation: Supported (store pepper ID with hash)

================================================================================
6. MITIGATIONS & BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

Password Storage Best Practices:

  1. Use Argon2id for new systems
     Config: time_cost=2, memory_cost=65536, parallelism=1

  2. Generate unique salt per user
     Length: 16+ bytes
     Source: cryptographically secure random

  3. Implement system-wide pepper
     Storage: Key vault / HSM (NOT in database)
     Rotation: Support pepper ID in hash

  4. Encrypt database at rest
     Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
     Key management: Separate from database

  5. Regular security audits
     Check: Hash parameters still appropriate
     Action: Increase work factor over time

MFA Implementation Best Practices:

  1. Offer multiple MFA options
     Primary: WebAuthn (hardware keys, biometric)
     Secondary: TOTP
     Avoid: SMS (vulnerable to SIM swap)

  2. Mandatory MFA for sensitive actions
     Examples: Password change, email change, large transactions

  3. Backup codes
     Generate: 10-12 one-time codes
     Storage: Hashed like passwords
     Requirement: User must download/print

  4. Account recovery process
     Options: Backup codes, support ticket, identity verification
     Avoid: SMS recovery (vulnerable)

  5. User education
     Teach: Phishing recognition, authenticator app usage
     Warn: Never share codes, verify URLs

WebAuthn Deployment:

  1. Start with optional enrollment
     Allow: Users to register WebAuthn
     Fallback: TOTP still available

  2. Gradually increase adoption
     Incentive: Faster login, better security
     Gamification: Badges, rewards

  3. Provide hardware keys for high-risk users
     Examples: Admins, executives, high-value accounts

  4. Document recovery procedures
     Lost device: Support verification + re-enrollment
     Stolen device: Revoke credential + investigation

Timing Attack Prevention:

  1. Always use constant-time comparison
     Python: hmac.compare_digest()
     C: memcmp_s() or explicit implementation
     JavaScript: crypto.timingSafeEqual()

  2. Never write custom crypto comparison
     Risk: Subtle timing bugs

  3. Add rate limiting
     Purpose: Makes timing analysis harder
     Config: Max 5-10 attempts/minute

  4. Consider random delays
     Purpose: Adds noise to timing measurements
     Caution: Not a substitute for constant-time

MITM Prevention:

  1. Use WebAuthn for phishing resistance
     Origin binding prevents relay

  2. Implement certificate pinning
     Mobile apps: Pin expected TLS certificates

  3. HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
     Force: HTTPS-only connections

  4. Monitor for suspicious patterns
     Examples: Login from new location, rapid repeated OTPs

  5. User education
     Teach: URL verification, certificate warnings
