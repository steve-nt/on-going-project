CONTRIBUTION GUIDE FOR RUNNING FORUM PROJECT
==============================================

As a Senior Software Developer, here's your step-by-step guide to start contributing:


STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT ARCHITECTURE (Day 1)
----------------------------------------------------
1.1 Read all specification files in this order:
    - forum.txt (core features: posts, comments, likes, SQLite, authentication)
    - forum-authentication.txt (OAuth with Google/GitHub)
    - forum-image-upload.txt (image handling: JPEG, PNG, GIF, max 20MB)
    - forum-advanced-features.txt (notifications, activity tracking, edit/delete)
    - forum-moderation.txt (user roles: Guest, User, Moderator, Admin)
    - forum-security.txt (HTTPS, SSL, rate limiting, encryption)

1.2 Explore the codebase structure:
    - /cmd/app - Backend server application
    - /cmd/client - Frontend/client application
    - /internal/backend - Backend logic (models, handlers, repositories)
    - /internal/frontend - Frontend logic
    - /internal/utils - Shared utilities
    - /static - Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
    - forum.db - SQLite database
    - forum_config.json - Configuration file


STEP 2: SET UP YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (Day 1)
----------------------------------------------------
2.1 Verify Go installation:
    $ go version  # Should be 1.23.0 or higher

2.2 Install dependencies:
    $ go mod download

2.3 Understand the tech stack:
    - Language: Go 1.23+
    - Database: SQLite3
    - Security: bcrypt (password hashing), UUID (session management)
    - No frontend frameworks (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS only)
    - Docker support required

2.4 Set up the database:
    - Check if forum.db exists
    - Review database schema
    - Check /back-up directory for database backups

2.5 Run the application locally:
    Terminal 1: $ cd cmd/app && go run .
    Terminal 2: $ cd cmd/client && go run .


STEP 3: UNDERSTAND THE BRANCH STRUCTURE (Day 1-2)
--------------------------------------------------
Current branches:
- main (production-ready code)
- feature/Authentication - OAuth implementation
- feature/homepageEndpoint - Homepage API work
- feature/models-repos - Database models and repositories
- leon-refactor - Code refactoring
- daniel-approach - Alternative implementation approach
- adding_daniel_stuff_to_refactor - Integration branch

3.1 Check each feature branch:
    $ git checkout feature/Authentication
    $ git log --oneline -10
    $ git diff main

3.2 Understand what each branch implements by reviewing commits

3.3 Return to main:
    $ git checkout main


STEP 4: IDENTIFY CURRENT STATE & GAPS (Day 2)
----------------------------------------------
4.1 Review the README.md TODO list:
    - Current TODO: Create comment endpoint (frontend ready, backend pending)

4.2 Test existing functionality:
    - User registration and login
    - Post creation
    - Category filtering
    - Like/Dislike functionality
    - Image upload (if implemented)
    - OAuth login (Google/GitHub)

4.3 Check for missing features from specs:
    - Notifications system
    - Activity tracking page
    - Edit/Remove posts/comments
    - Moderation panel
    - HTTPS/SSL setup
    - Rate limiting
    - Role-based access control


STEP 5: REVIEW CODE QUALITY & PATTERNS (Day 2)
-----------------------------------------------
5.1 Study the project structure:
    - How models are defined
    - How repositories interact with database
    - How handlers process requests
    - How frontend communicates with backend

5.2 Check for:
    - Error handling patterns
    - Logging implementation (check back-up/migration files)
    - Security practices (password encryption, session management)
    - Database query patterns (SELECT, INSERT, CREATE)
    - Cookie/session management

5.3 Look for code smells or technical debt


STEP 6: SET UP YOUR CONTRIBUTION WORKFLOW (Day 2-3)
----------------------------------------------------
6.1 Create your own feature branch:
    $ git checkout -b feature/your-name-feature-description

6.2 Configure Git properly:
    $ git config user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

6.3 Understand the team's workflow:
    - Are pull requests required?
    - What's the code review process?
    - Are there any CI/CD pipelines?
    - What testing is expected?


STEP 7: START WITH QUICK WINS (Day 3)
--------------------------------------
7.1 Fix the current TODO:
    - Implement the create comment endpoint (backend)
    - Test with existing frontend handler

7.2 Add unit tests:
    - Create test files for critical functions
    - Follow Go testing conventions (*_test.go)

7.3 Improve documentation:
    - Document API endpoints
    - Add code comments where logic is complex
    - Update README.md if needed


STEP 8: PICK YOUR FIRST MAJOR CONTRIBUTION (Day 4+)
----------------------------------------------------
Choose based on your strengths and project priorities:

Option A - Security Focus:
    - Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates
    - Add rate limiting
    - Enhance encryption (database, sessions)

Option B - Feature Development:
    - Build notifications system
    - Create activity tracking page
    - Implement edit/delete functionality

Option C - Moderation System:
    - Implement user roles (Guest, User, Moderator, Admin)
    - Build moderation panel
    - Add reporting functionality

Option D - Code Quality:

    - Merge pending feature branches
    - Improve error handling
    - Add comprehensive tests


STEP 9: BEST PRACTICES TO FOLLOW
---------------------------------
9.1 Before coding:
    - Pull latest changes: $ git pull origin main
    - Create feature branch from main
    - Write down what you plan to implement

9.2 While coding:
    - Commit often with clear messages
    - Follow Go best practices and idioms
    - Handle all errors properly
    - Test your changes locally
    - Don't break existing functionality

9.3 Code standards:
    - Use standard Go packages when possible
    - Only allowed external packages: sqlite3, bcrypt, uuid
    - No React, Angular, Vue or other frontend frameworks
    - Respect good practices and clean code principles

9.4 Security considerations:
    - Always encrypt passwords (bcrypt)
    - Use UUID for sessions
    - Validate and sanitize all inputs
    - Handle file uploads securely (check size, type)
    - Prevent SQL injection (use parameterized queries)

9.5 Before submitting:
    - Run tests: $ go test ./...
    - Check formatting: $ go fmt ./...
    - Verify build: $ go build ./cmd/app
    - Test manually in browser


STEP 10: COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION
---------------------------------------
10.1 Ask questions:
    - Review existing issues/PRs
    - Consult with team members about design decisions
    - Clarify requirements before implementing

10.2 Document your work:
    - Update relevant documentation
    - Add comments for complex logic
    - Write clear commit messages
    - Describe your changes in PR descriptions

10.3 Code review:
    - Request reviews from team members
    - Be open to feedback
    - Review others' code when possible

SUCCESS METRICS
---------------
- Code compiles without errors
- All tests pass
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Existing functionality not broken
- Code follows project conventions
- Good documentation and comments
- Successful code review


NOTES
-----
- This is a learning project implementing a full-featured forum
- Features build progressively (basic → advanced → security)
- Docker deployment is required
- Security is paramount (HTTPS, encryption, rate limiting)
- Multiple user roles need to be supported
- The project uses standard Go and minimal dependencies

Good luck with your contributions! Start small, understand the codebase,
and gradually take on larger features.
